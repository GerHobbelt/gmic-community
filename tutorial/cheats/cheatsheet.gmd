|![small_e](img/e_ltr_sm.png)|Welcome to the G'MIC command line interface (_cli_) cheatsheet directory. Cheats consist of pithy recipes for common tasks and/or ways to avoid typical gaffes.\nG'MIC is a _command line interface tool._ Use your [operating system's CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29) to:\n1. put images on an _image list_,\n2. apply an image processing _pipeline_ to _image list items_,\n3. output results in a _well-understood manner_.\nIf you have not used the G'MIC _cli_ ___at all!___ (as in: ___never!___), then visit [Tutorial Introduction](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/) and [Basics](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/basics.html). Can’t cheat unless you know what you’re cheating at.

In G'MIC, _pipelines_ — ordered command sequences — operate on _image lists_. A `gmic` pipeline typically has these parts:

|- `gmic` | _<input list items>_ | _<commands>_ | _<output adaptors>_ | `output[` _<selection>_ `]` _<filename template>_
|Start the interpreter | Populate the _image list_ with [-input](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/input.html) variants | [operate](https://gmic.eu/reference/list_of_commands.html#top) on [selections](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/command_decorations.html#image_selection) of image list items | Use [-cut or -normalize](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/images_as_data_sets.html#data_management) and friends to adapt list items in a _well understood manner_. | [-output](https://gmic.eu/reference/input_output_properties.html#top) a selection of adapted list items to storage.

Apart from starting the interpreter, the remaining pipeline parts may be broken up and interleaved. There may be other less vital parts as well. Example: [display intermediary list items](https://gmic.eu/reference/image_and_data_viewers.html#top). When pipeline proof-reading, be comfortable identifying which part does what. No? Then go to the more prolix [tutorials](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/).

## Check List

|- 1. |Installed the _G'MIC Command Line Interface_ ( [Tell me how](https://gmic.eu/download.html) )?| □
| 2. |Know the difference between the _cli_ and _gmic-qt_ ?| □
| 3. |Know how to access and use your operating system [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29)?| □
| 4. |Understand what _output in a well understood manner_ means?| □

## Bail out
If you miss a check then you are on the wrong page. Bail. Out. Now.

|- 1. |There is no help here on using G’MIC in a paint program (_gmic-qt_). Try [discuss.pixls.us](https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/gmic/10) or [Gimp Chat](http://gimpchat.com/viewforum.php?f=28).
| 2. |Help for _outputting images in a well understood manner_ may be found at [Images](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/images.html) and [Images as Data Sets](https://gmic.eu/tutorial/images_as_data_sets.html).

## Good to Go
With G’MIC _cli_ you:

|- 1. |Put images on the _image list_
| 2. |Apply a set of _image processing commands_
| 3. |Output results in a _well-understood manner_

Put these three injunctions on a yellow sticky pad. Paste it within eyesight. Until it becomes muscle memory, be able to identify:

|- 1. |Where and how you populate the image list,
| 2. |Apply image processing commands,
| 3. |Output results _in a well-understood manner_.

for any _cli_ command you write. Basic Pipeline Anatomy: Populate. Apply. Output.

The _well-understood manner_ injunction delineates G’MIC _cli_ from paint programs. The _cli_ provides vast image processing freedoms. Even the freedom to be silly. To provide freedom efficiently — _including freedom from nagging software!_ ("Are You Sure You Want To Do That? `OK`") the _cli_ removes all guard rails. _Sans_ guard rails, one may output signed floating point data to Portable Network Graphics (`.png`) containers. The _cli_ trusts you have your reasons. Corollary: Know what output you want and how you are going to use it.
