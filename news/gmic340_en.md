# 1. _G'MIC_ in a Nutshell

[G'MIC](https://gmic.eu) is an open-source [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) for [digital image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image) manipulation and processing, developed in the [_IMAGE_](https://www.greyc.fr/equipes/image/) team at the [_GREYC_](https://www.greyc.fr/) research laboratory in Caen ([_UMR CNRS_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Research_Unit) 6072).

It defines various user interfaces for applying a wide range of algorithms to images and signals. The core of the project is the [_G'MIC_ scripting language interpreter](https://gmic.eu/reference/) specifically designed to ease the prototyping and implementation of new image processing algorithms and operators. Users can harness operators from the several hundred already implemented, or write their own custom operators. These can then be accessed through the several user interfaces that the project offers.

The most popular G'MIC interfaces are:

1. [`gmic`](https://gmic.eu/reference/), a command-line tool, and a useful complement to [_ImageMagick_](https://www.imagemagick.org/) or [_GraphicsMagick_](http://www.graphicsmagick.org) for processing, generating, or analyzing images from a [_shell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29);
2. [*G'MICâ€¯Online*](https://gmicol.greyc.fr/) a web service where many _G'MIC_ filters can be applied on images, directly from a web browser;
3. [*G'MIC-Qt*](https://github.com/GreycLab/gmic-qt) a popular plugin supported by many digital image editing applications such as [_GIMP_](https://www.gimp.org/), [_Krita_](https://krita.org/), [_Paint.NET_](https://www.getpaint.net/), and [_Photoshop_](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) (thanks to its availability as a [_8bf plugin_](https://github.com/0xC0000054/gmic-8bf)).

# 2. What's New in Version __3.4.0__?

Version __3.4.0__ of _G'MIC_ focuses on _stability_ and _long-term support_: After more than 15 years of continuous development, _G'MIC's_ core elements have been extensively put through their paces. We now strive for stabilizing the key _Application Programmer's Interfaces (APIs):_  [`libgmic`](https://gmic.eu/libgmic.html), to integrate _G'MIC_ features into _C_ or _C++_ code, [_G'MIC-Qt_ plugin](https://github.com/GreycLab/gmic-qt/blob/master/NEW_HOST_HOWTO.md) to port the plugin to new hosts, and the syntax of the _G'MIC_ script language itself, including the freezing of the parameter settings of the _G'MIC_ commands already available.

Thus, all versions of the _3.4.x_ branch will be dedicated to bug fixing and developing features that do not require modification of the language core, such as developing new filters or image processing operators. Attention will be paid to ensuring maximum backward compatibility among _3.4.x_ releases. In this sense, this version _3.4.0_ represents a long term milestone release in the project's history.

That said, in the run-up from versions _3.3_ to _3.4_, there have been notable improvements to several user interfaces:

  - ** _G'MIC Online_ ** (*G'MICol*): This web service allows users to apply _G'MIC_ filters to their uploaded images through their web browsers. It has existed for several years, largely unchanged from its original form, while interactive web techniques have advanced. In 2024, the [_DDA_](https://www.greyc.fr/laboratoire/dda/) (_Application Development and Deployment_) team at the _GREYC_ laboratory undertook a complete overhaul of _G'MIC Online_. The web service now sports a new look, employs significant user interface improvements, with more intuitive widgets, an enhanced preview window, a choice between light and dark themes, revamped handling of filter favorites and better integration of the web service with the _G'MIC_ core, such that web users can now access recently developed filters and image processing pipelines.

===

===

Visit [_G'MIC Online_](https://gmicol.greyc.fr/) and give it a real-world test ðŸ˜±! And don't hesitate to report any issues. In any case, a big thank you to our colleagues in the _DDA_ team for this noteworthy overhaul!

- ** _G'MIC-Qt_ Plugin**: Over the past year, the plugin has acquired more than __40 new image processing filters__, [detailed below](#_3_details_of_the_new_filters). Many employ the new _Random Parameters_ button, which generates arbitrary filter settings, furnishing rapid previews that can be quickly evaluated for practical or aesthetic worth.

===
[![Random Parameters button in the G'MIC-Qt plugin](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/randomize_parameters_en.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/randomize_parameters_en.jpg)
_Fig.2.2. G'MIC-Qt Plugin: The new Random Parameters button assigns random values to the selected filter's parameters._
===


- **`gmic` CLI Tool**: All filters created by the developer community are now integrated within the command-line tool executable. There are no longer discrepancies in the number of default filters available between the _G'MIC-Qt_ plugin and the `gmic` CLI tool. Previously, users needed to force filter updates with `$ gmic update` to align environments.

`gmic` now offers over **4000 functions** to process your images from the command line. Notable efforts have been made to improve the integrated image viewer available through the `display` command, which has been completely re-tooled to allow viewing different image types within the same interface.

===
[![Command 'display'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/command_display.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/command_display.jpg)
_Fig.2.3. `gmic` CLI Tool: The G'MIC image viewer has been completely re-implemented and allows viewing different image types within the same interface._
===

This is also the case for the mathematical function or 1D signal viewer (command `plot`), which has been revamped:

===
[![Command 'plot'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/command_plot.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/command_plot.jpg)
_Fig.2.4. `gmic` CLI Tool: The G'MIC viewer for mathematical functions or 1D signals has also been re-implemented._
===

This makes `gmic` a handy tool, even if we limit ourselves to viewing images or signals on the command line.

- **Other Improvements:**
  - The integrated mathematical expression evaluator has evolved significantly: it is one of the essential bricks of the _G'MIC_ language, as it is responsible for evaluating the results of the mathematical operations needed in scripts (needless to say, calculations are done all the time in image processing). This evaluator has been enriched with many new functions, especially for the calculation and processing of vectors and matrices, and native manipulation of heaps.
  - Many native (_C++_) functions formerly in the shared binary object library have now been entirely rewritten in the _G'MIC_ language. This facilitates their maintenance and further development, as future work can be scripted for immediate effect, instead of being subject to compilation and linking. Situated at the script level, such modifications become immediately available to users, as distribution of binaries will no longer be required.
  - The commands for loading/saving 3D meshes in `.obj` (_Wavefront_) format have been improved, and new commands for processing/creating 3D meshes have emerged (e.g., to visualize the normal vectors at the vertices of a mesh, as illustrated in the video below). And, no, this is not a rotten apple:

===
[![Example of 3D rendering](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/render3d.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/render3d.mp4)
_Fig.2.5. 3D mesh management within G'MIC has been enriched with new commands._
===

That's all for the general improvements of the various interfaces offered by the framework. Let's now move on to the details of the new filters and image processing features that have appeared in _G'MIC_ over the past twelve months.

# 3. Details of the New Filters

In this extensive section, we categorize and describe the recent filters by type of use: [_Photo Retouching_](#_3_1_photo_retouching), [_Distortion Filters_](#_3_2_distortion_filters), [_Degradation Filters_](#_3_3_degradation_filters), [_Rendering and Texture Filters_](#_3_4_rendering_and_texture_filters), and finally [_Artistic Effects_](#_3_5_artistic_effects).

## 3.1. Photo Retouching

Three interesting filters have appeared in the _G'MIC-Qt_ plugin to help photographers retouch their digital shots.

First, the **Colors / Mixer [Generic]** filter, a color channel mixing filter that offers the possibility to choose from no less than 16 different color spaces/representations for mixing (_[CMY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMY), [CMYK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMYK), [HCY](https://code.google.com/archive/p/colour-space-viewer/), [HSI](https://www.blackice.com/colorspaceHSI.htm), [HSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), [HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV), [Jzazbz](https://opg.optica.org/oe/fulltext.cfm?uri=oe-25-13-15131&id=368272), [Lab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIELAB_color_space), [Lch](https://sensing.konicaminolta.us/us/blog/understanding-the-cie-lch-color-space/), [OKlab](https://bottosson.github.io/posts/oklab/), [RGB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_spaces), [RYB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RYB_color_model), [XYZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIE_1931_color_space), [YCbCr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr), [YIQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YIQ), and [YUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV)_). This constitutes a good alternative to traditional contrast or color enhancement tools, to retouch photos that might be a bit dull.

===
[![Filter 'Colors / Mixer (Generic)'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_mixer_generic.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_mixer_generic.jpg)
_Fig.3.1.1. The __Colors / Mixer [Generic]__ filter enriches the already available arsenal of filters for contrast and color enhancement._
===

Let's also talk about the **Details / Sharpen [Alpha]** filter, which, as its name suggests, allows for fine detail enhancement in photographs. It minimizes the appearance of edge halos, a common artifact arising from many detail enhancement filters. The **Details/Sharpen [Alpha]** filter is based on an original technique of pyramidal decomposition of the image obtained from an [_Alpha blending_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing) operator.

===

_Fig.3.1.3. Before/After details illustrating the outcome of the __Details / Sharpen [Alpha]__ filter._
===

Finally, the **Layers / Spatial Blend Multi-Layers** filter merges into a single image multiple shots from the same viewpoint, while harnessing a spatial linear gradient between the various views. For example, one can photograph the same scene over day and night time intervals, then employ this spatial fusion filter to create time-transitional images like the one illustrated below:

===
[![Filter 'Layers / Spatial Blend Multi-Layers'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_spatial_blend_multilayers2.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_spatial_blend_multilayers2.jpg)
_Fig.3.1.4. The __Layers / Spatial Blend Multi-Layers__ filter allows for merging multiple photographs with an adjustable spatial linear gradient._
===

(__Credits__: the images used in the figure above are from the video [_Stunning New York City skyline timelapse: Day to night_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDo73Njxdqc) by the YouTube channel _Rumble Viral_.)

The following video illustrates the complete process, using the _G'MIC-Qt_ plugin under _GIMP 2.10_:

===

## 3.2. Distortion Filters

Let's now move on to a set of new effects available to distort your images in various ways.

First, the **Deformations / Distort [RBF]** filter, which deforms an image based on adjustable key points. A [_Radial Basis Function_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function) interpolation function alters distances non-linearly, applying contractions here, expansions there, all in a user-specifiable way. Mathematically inclined users can specify their own radial basis functions, placing few limits on the kinds of possible distortions.

===
[![Filter 'Deformations / Distort (RBF)'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_deformations_distort_rbf.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_deformations_distort_rbf.jpg)
_Fig.3.2.1. The __Deformations / Distort [RBF]__ filter allows for various distortions based on RBFs. Here, specifying the radial basis function phi(r) = log(0.1+r)._
===

Next, let's mention the arrival of an entirely new category **Map Projection**, which now contains fourteen filters for maps initially in the form of [_equirectangular projection_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection) (cylindrical equidistant maps). These may be further converted into other types of projections. This series of filters has been contributed by _Kristian JÃ¤rventaus_, a member of the [_Cartographers Guild forum_](https://www.cartographersguild.com/showthread.php?t=47591), a forum specialized in cartography.

===
[![Filters in the 'Map Projection' category](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_map_projection.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_map_projection.jpg)

_Fig.3.2.2. The new __Map Projection__ filters offers several geographical map projection algorithms._
===

We also note the arrival of the **Deformations / Square to Circle [alt]** filter, which transforms any rectangle (or square) centered in an image into an ellipse (or circle), and vice versa. A very specialized filter, with â€” at first glance â€” obviously few apparent applications, yet when you need it, you'll be glad to have it at hand! For example, we used it below to transform a round painting frame into a square frame:

===
[![Filter 'Deformations / Square to Circle (alt)'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_square_to_circle.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_square_to_circle.jpg)

_Fig.3.2.3. The __Deformations / Square to Circle [alt]__ filter allows converting square or rectangular objects into round or elliptical objects, and vice versa._
===

Finally, let's conclude this review of the new image deformation filters with the **Deformations / PoincarÃ© Disk** filter, which generates [_PoincarÃ© disks_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_disk), a family of geometric figures based on hyperbolic geometries, as illustrated in the following figure:

===
[![Filter 'Deformations / PoincarÃ© Disk'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/poincare_disk.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/poincare_disk.jpg)
_Fig.3.2.4. Some examples of PoincarÃ© disks, generated by the __Deformations / PoincarÃ© Disk__ filter._
===

But where it becomes interesting is that this filter also allows you to deform images by projecting them onto these very particular geometries:

===

_Fig.3.2.5. Projection of an image onto a PoincarÃ© disk._
===

For example, we used this filter, with slight modifications, to generate the short animation, _"Flyover of the PoincarÃ© Planet"_, which illustrates the astonishing fractal properties of these geometric oddities:

===

===

## 3.3. Degradation Filters

Sometimes, one seeks to deliberately _degrade_ images, either to simulate a real phenomenon, such as motion blur, sensor noise and the like, or in the pursuit of a purely aesthetic effect ([_Glitch Art_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art)). For these purposes, the following new effects have been added to _G'MIC_:

- The **Rendering / CRT Scanlines** and **Degradations / CRT Phosphors** filters mimic the image display of [_cathode-ray tubes (CRT)_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode_ray_tube), by simulating two characteristic effects of CRT displays, namely the [_Scanline effect_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scan_line) and [_phosphor excitation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphor). These two filters were created in collaboration with [_Romain HÃ©rault_](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/romain-herault-91a596137), a new contributor who recently joined the _GREYC_ laboratory.

===

_Fig.3.3.2. The __Degradations / CRT Phosphors__ filter simulates the phosphor display technique of CRT displays._
===

- The **Degradations / Blur [Motion]** filter emulates path-based motion blur, with user-adjustable, spline-based trajectories which may be directly altered through key points in the _G'MIC-Qt_ preview window:

===
[![Filter 'Degradations / Blur (Motion)'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_blur_motion.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_blur_motion.jpg)
_Fig.3.3.3. The __Degradations / Blur [Motion]__ filter simulates motion blur._
===

- The **Degradations / Sloppy Mess** filter is intended for Glitch Art enthusiasts. It's one of the first filters by a new contributor, [Prawnsushi](http://prawnsushi.free.fr/), who recently took an interest in the _G'MIC_ language for filter creation. This effect offers wide-ranging parameters to produce a panoply of disjoint and disassociated outputs.

===

_Fig.3.3.4. The __Degradations / Sloppy Mess__ filter deliberately creates artistic digital artifacts on your images._
===

## 3.4. Rendering and Texture Filters

Rendering filters, by and large, do not require input images; they summon new imagery by algorithmic means through [_procedural generation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation).

- The **Rendering / Underwoods** filter, another creation of _Prawnsushi_, is nothing less than an __underwood generator__! One might say it's not very useful, and indeed it's not a filter that image processors, photographers, or illustrators will incorporate into their daily work.

Yet this filter illustrates the whole philosophy of the _G'MIC_ project: To produce software that fosters __algorithmic creativity__. _G'MIC_ facilitates the construction of __all kinds of filters__ (useful or less useful), and allows __free sharing__ with other _cognoscenti_ of this viewpoint. In practice, this filter has the simple merit of its own existence, there for anyone to try, and thereby â€” possibly! â€” discover the extraordinary. It uses very little memory resources, perhaps a few dozen bytes, thanks to the compactness of the _G'MIC_ language design. And moreover, the results are quite cool! And be assured that it will inevitably serve, one day or another, an artist wanting to synthesize an underwood image in two mouse clicks!

===
[![Filter 'Rendering / Underwoods'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_underwoods.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_underwoods.jpg)
[![Filter 'Rendering / Underwoods'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_underwoods2.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_underwoods2.jpg)
_Fig.3.4.1. Examples of underwood image renderings by the __Rendering / Underwoods__ filter._
===

- The **Patterns / Reaction-Diffusion** filter synthesizes textures modeled after [_reaction-diffusion systems_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction-diffusion_system).

===
[![Filter 'Patterns / Reaction-Diffusion'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_reaction_diffusion.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_reaction_diffusion.jpg)
_Fig.3.4.2. The __Patterns / Reaction-Diffusion__ filter in the G'MIC-Qt plugin._
===

Again, the interest in this type of filter may seem quite limited. However, it's the perfect example of a texture that â€” in a pipeline of filters of a similar ilk â€” serves as the basis for generative art. Take a texture created by this filter, apply some of the other effects available in _G'MIC_ (e.g., the **Deformations / Drop Water** filter), and you're ready to produce fun animations like the one below:

===
[![Filter 'Patterns / Reaction-Diffusion'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/water_reaction_diffusion.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/water_reaction_diffusion.mp4)
===

- The **Rendering / Spline Spirograph** filter is inspired by the [_Spirograph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph) game for generating parametric curves, creating intriguing texture and color effects. The presence of the _Random Parameters_ button in the _G'MIC-Qt_ plugin is particularly welcome here, as it quickly obtains a varied panorama of diverse results!

===
[![Filter 'Rendering / Spline Spirograph'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_spirograph.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_spirograph.jpg)

_Fig.3.4.3. The __Rendering / Spline Spirograph__ filter and some rendering examples._
===

This filter also offers an animated output mode, allowing for the synthesis of short videos like this one:

===
[![Filter 'Rendering / Spline Spirograph'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_spirograph4.gif)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_spirograph2.mp4)
===

- The **Rendering / ABN Filigrees** filter also knows how to draw interesting parametric curves, inspired this time by the filigrees found on stock certificates or paper money. This filter pays homage to the _American Bank Note Company_, an engraver of financial paper, active on Wall Street from the 19th century until sixty years ago.

===

_Fig.3.4.4. The __Rendering / ABN Filigrees__ filter._
===

- The **Rendering / Random Signature** filter is also an amusing curve generator: it aims to draw random signatures, as illustrated in the video below:

===
[![Filter 'Rendering / Random Signature'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/random_signature.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/random_signature.mp4)
_Fig.3.4.5. The __Rendering / Random Signature__ filter creates random signatures._
===

Again, a filter whose usefulness cannot be debated: [_"It's completely useless, so it's absolutely indispensable!"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A9r%C3%B4me_Bonaldi).

- And to finish this section, let's mention the **Rendering / Twisted Rays** filter which, as its name suggests, generates a twisted rays effect. The use of this filter will probably remain quite unfathomable in the near term. But, even now, there may be among thousands of _G'MIC_ users a creator seeking this precise effect â€” _and now they can!_ â˜º

===

_Fig.3.4.5. The __Rendering / Twisted Rays__ filter creates a swirl of rays on your images._
===

This filter can, for example, be used to create psychedelic animated effects like this:

===

## 3.5. Artistic Effects

To conclude this list of new _G'MIC_ filters, here are some miscellaneous filters grouped under the term "Artistic", a term used in image processing software for filters that are hard to categorizeâ€¦

- The **Artistic / Stringify** filter decomposes an input image into quantized color blobs and connects the points (subsampled) located on the contours of these blobs with color segments. The rendering may resemble the curves obtained with the Spirograph game.

===
[![Filter 'Artistic / Stringify'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/filter_stringify.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/filter_stringify.jpg)
_Fig.3.5.1. The __Artistic / Stringify__ filter creates image abstractions from color segments._
===

- The **Black & White / Filaments** filter is based on the projection of thousands of particles from one or more edges of the image, with trajectories deformed by the image's contour geometry. The drawing of these thousands of trajectories with semi-transparent colors produces images like these:

_Fig.3.5.2. The __Black & White / Filaments__ filter transforms your images into sets of deformed filaments._
===

- The **Arrays & Tiles / Loose Photos** filter simulates an effect of throwing photos haphazardly on a table, so that the content of the photos constitutes a global image, as specified by the filter's settings. Many parameters are adjustable (density, size and ratio of photographs, shading parameters, etc.), giving the user a great deal of freedom over the final rendering.

===

- The **Rendering / Quick Copyright** filter, which already existed in previous versions, has been re-implemented from scratch. It facilitates the insertion of a copyright text (or text signature) on a digital image. It now has many parameters to finely adjust the position of the text, its size, font, and other aspects. Combined with the automation capabilities of the _G'MIC_ language, this filter is suited for easily inserting text, in a standardized way, on thousands of photographs.

- Finally, the **Patterns / Random Rectangles** filter transforms an image into a random partition of colored rectangles, giving an abstract image effect, vaguely in the manner of [_Piet Mondrian_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian).

One can easily imagine using this filter to generate decorative object textures, as demonstrated in this animation below, which starts from a pure noise image:

# 4. A Software with Varied Uses

As we have shown, _G'MIC_ has multiple facets with a wide range of applications. The user community is not limited to digital artists but also includes researchers, programmers, algorithmicians, etc. Below are some other varied uses of the software.

- **Denoising JWST Images:**

In October 2023, we learned from [_M.J. McCaughrean_](https://piaille.fr/@markmccaughrean@mastodon.social), senior researcher at the [_ESA_ (_European Space Agency_)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Space_Agency) (retired in 2024), that _G'MIC_ was used by some people within the _ESA_ to process images from the [_James Webb Space Telescope_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope) (_JWST_), particularly for attenuating the frequency noise appearing on some images acquired by the telescope (using the **Repair / Banding Denoise** filter, among others).

_G'MIC_ was used in conjunction with among other software for creating the cover image of the [_Nature_ magazine, vol. 622, issue 7981](https://www.nature.com/nature/volumes/622/issues/7981) on October 5, 2023, as confirmed by _M.J. McGaughrean_ and indicated in [_the associated publication_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06551-1), of which he is a co-author.

_Fig.4.1. Use of G'MIC for denoising images of the Herbig-Haro 211 protostar, acquired by the JWST._
===

It was a pleasant surprise for us developers to learn this and realize that _G'MIC_ was being used in the field of astrophysics.

- **Creative Coding:**

_G'MIC_ proves to be a valuable ally for [_creative coding_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_coding), due to its ability to easily generate and manipulate images through its standard library of operators. Over the past year, we have enjoyed exploring its possibilities for algorithmic creation of images and animations, a small selection of which is shown here:

Let's start with this little animation of swirling snowflakes ([_source code_](https://pastebin.com/02AsBKNg), 30 lines):

===

_Fig.4.2. Snowflake animation generated by a G'MIC script._
===

Then let's continue with this amusing variant of the [_Rock-Paper-Scissors_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors) game, where each pixel in an image (whose initial random values represent either _0: a rock_, _1: paper_, or _2: scissors_) plays consecutively with its 8 neighbors, keeping the element that won the most. In the second phase, we stylize the sequence of these different label images, again, with the **Drop Water** filter, resulting in the following animation, which we might call _"Hell's Soup"_ ([_source code_](https://pastebin.com/YXFbiFnu), 30 lines).

===

_Fig.4.3. Rock-Paper-Scissors game animation, where all the pixels in an image play simultaneously._
===

Finally, let's dive back into the wonderful world of [_Mandelbrot fractals_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), starting with this rendering of the Mandelbrot set using the [_Orbit Trap_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit_trap) technique, allowing the rendering to be mapped with a color image:

===
[![Rendering of the Mandelbrot Set using the "Orbit Trap" method](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/orbit_trap.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/orbit_trap.jpg)
_Fig.4.4. Rendering of the Mandelbrot Set using the Orbit Trap method._
===

Then, with another type of rendering known as [_Buddhabrot_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhabrot), but here considering complex series of the type *z_[n+1]=z_[n]^p + c*, and linearly varying the real exponent *p* between 0 and 6 (rather than keeping *p=2* as for the classic Mandelbrot set), to generate each image of the animation below (source code and details [_on this page_](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/intriguing-shapes-in-buddhabrot-like-fractals)):

===
[![Buddhabrot Type Rendering for Complex Series with Exponent](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/buddhabrot.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/buddhabrot.mp4)
_Fig.4.5. Fractal variations around the Buddhabrot._
===

Note that generating these high-resolution modified _Buddhabrot_ images requires significant computation time (a few minutes per image). I find this animation intriguing: it is quite easy to see/hallucinate familiar shapes when you look closely at some frames of the animation, a bit like when you look at clouds in the sky (if [_you think you see_](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/intriguing-shapes-in-buddhabrot-like-fractals) in this animation, a bear's head, an old man sitting, a character's silhouette, a dragon's head, ..., then you are not alone in being a bit of a dreamer â˜º).

- **Image Conversion for _String Art_ **:

[_String Art_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_art) is a form of artistic creation characterized by the use of colored threads connected between points (most often nails) to form a pattern or reproduce a photograph (usually portraits). As an experiment, we wrote a _G'MIC_ script that tries to transform a user-selected grayscale input image into a series of instructions to follow to connect numbered nails with a monochrome thread, to reproduce the image as faithfully as possible (considering the constraints specific to this mode of creation):

===
[![Attempt to use G'MIC for 'String Art'](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/thumbs/string_art.png)](https://gmic.eu/gmic340/img/string_art.jpg)
_Fig.4.6. More or less successful attempt to use G'MIC for String Art._
===

Can you recognize who is supposed to be represented in the photo below? An attempt not necessarily crowned with success, which deserves to be explored further (especially by managing threads of different colors), but which nevertheless illustrates the multiple possibilities for experimentation that the _G'MIC_ framework allows!

- **Other Related Links**:

To conclude, here are some miscellaneous links that demonstrate the versatility of _G'MIC_:

    1. **Steganography**: How to hide data in a noise image? The `rand` command can generate [_random values with density_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function), meaning their probability density is a function specified by the user. This has, for example, the application of hiding 256x256 images in histograms of 16-bit/channel noise images, as [_detailed on this page_](https://discuss.pixls.us/t/new-function-rand-pdf-random-values-following-a-custom-distribution).

    2. **Artistic Galleries**: [_Ivelieu_](https://deviantart.com/ivelieu/gallery) and [_Gannjondal_](https://deviantart.com/gannjondal/gallery) are two artists on the _Deviant Art_ site who sometimes use _G'MIC_ in their artistic creation process. Take a look at their respective galleries, it's worth it!

    3. We learned from _Gilles Caulier_ that the next version of the photo management program _digiKam_ 8.4.0 [_will include a G'MIC processing tool_](https://www.reddit.com/r/kde/comments/1d67s1d/next_digikam_840_photo_manager_program_will/) within the _Batch Queue Manager_, which will allow _digiKam_ users to integrate _G'MIC_ filters into their post-processing workflows.

    4. [_Thiojoe_](https://www.thiojoe.com/) is a YouTuber who produces videos about technology and is a programmer in his spare time. He started developing a free tool based on _G'MIC_ to easily generate animations, a tool that you can [_find here_](https://github.com/ThioJoe/Gmic-Animation-Tools). It only works on _Windows_ for now, but we'll keep an eye on it.

    5. Finally, let's mention the _YouTube_ channel of [_JustCallMeInsane_](https://www.youtube.com/@JustCallMeInsane/search?query=g%27mic), a digital illustrator using _Krita_. She recently made a series of videos exploring the different categories of filters in the _G'MIC-Qt_ plugin for _Krita_. We hope in passing that the _Krita_ development team, which manages its own version of the plugin, will be able to update it quickly.

And that's it for the latest news around the _G'MIC_ project and its new version _3.4.0_.

# 5. Conclusions

We could summarize this report by saying that the _G'MIC_ project "continues its journey".

_G'MIC_ remains, of course, a modest project, developed and maintained by a small team (of enthusiasts), but with a growing number of users and increasingly varied usage feedback. This framework has the chance to be developed within the _GREYC_, a public research laboratory, supported by the laboratory's supervisors (the _CNRS_ "Computer Science" institute, the University of Caen, and _ENSICAEN_), and encouraged by the laboratory's management.

And even if most of the development on this project has probably already been done (more than 15 years of development after all), we are confident that _G'MIC_ will continue to evolve; in any case, we will try, as long as it remains useful to image processors of all kinds!
